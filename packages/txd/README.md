# txd — `@terminus-os/txd`

The estate daemon for k12 boxes: the authoritative, event-sourced tmux control
plane (Bun/TypeScript). tmuxctld successor, extracted out of the deprecated
Token-OS checkout per the ruled `txd-extraction-spec` (namespace LOCKED:
**txd** primary; **tx** is its single rote auxiliary client — "tx pings txd;
txd does the thing"). The daemon's design is the ruled `k12-daemon-spec`
(§1–§12); behavior did not change in the move, only the home, the name, the
contracts source, and the public route shape.

## What it is

- **Event-sourced core.** One append-only Postgres event stream (`txd.events`)
  is the single source of truth; the three day-one read models
  (`current_bindings`, `freelist`, `activity_board`) are pure projections
  rebuilt by replay — nobody writes them.
- **Canonical-id membrane.** Raw tmux `%id`s never cross upward. Every response,
  log line, and event is scrubbed (`assertNoTmuxId`); a breach fails loud.
- **Send chokepoint.** Enqueue-by-default; typed gate/refusal reasons; a
  ledger-bound agent seat bypasses the operator typing guard, while an unbound
  pane reads tmux client activity at admission and drain. Held sends recheck on
  guard expiry and release with an observable reason. Each receipt carries the
  send's own resolution.
- **Reconcile = replay.** Out-of-band pane death surfaces as a
  `contradiction_flagged` event (p0, fail-loud in bring-up mode), never a
  silently synthesized lifecycle.
- **Boot-time estate constructor.** `constructEstate()` stands one persistent
  tmux session (`main`) at boot: `palace` (W/N/S/E), `somnium`
  (W/N/S/NE/SE), five `council:*` singleton windows, and two `mechanicus:*`
  singleton windows. Every pane is resolved only through `@canonical_id`.
  Construction is idempotent; an existing non-canonical estate is refused
  loudly and must be cleared out-of-band before a later boot. txd is the
  constructor; tx never constructs.

## HTTP surface — the RATIFIED planes

Bound to loopback only; ingress is via the per-box edge proxy ONLY, under the
`/txd` route prefix. Routes are grouped by caller/trust plane; behavior under
each route is the ruled daemon behavior, unchanged.

| Method | Path                    | Purpose                                          |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/ctl/health`           | Honest liveness + build + tmux reachability      |
| POST   | `/ctl/reconcile`        | Replay-driven reconcile; p0 on contradiction     |
| POST   | `/agents/launch`        | Atomic reg-audited seat bind / handover          |
| POST   | `/agents/send`          | Send chokepoint (enqueue-by-default)             |
| POST   | `/agents/close`         | Generic close: reap process, keep estate pane, seat → freelist |
| POST   | `/agents/subscribe`     | Bound-keyed close-on-next-stop subscription (satiated-once) |
| POST   | `/ingress/hooks/stop`   | Stop-hook door: record / dedupe / refuse-ghost; fires auto-close |
| POST   | `/ingress/hooks/<type>` | Every other pinned vendor hook type → 410 Gone (side-effect-free) |
| GET    | `/tmux/read/estate`     | Estate observation: seats, panes, occupancy incl. bindings |

- `/agents/*` is the **deliberate-action plane**: every route directly under it
  is a deliberate action, one-for-one.
- `/ingress/hooks/*` is the **cross-service hook invariant**: a service that
  accepts hooks must expose an endpoint for EVERY vendor hook type; unused ones
  quick-return 410. The proxy broadcasts every inbound hook to all hook
  consumers and ignores 410s. The hook-type enumeration is pinned in
  `@terminus-os/contracts/hooks` from the actual claude-code and codex hook
  contracts.
- `/tmux/read/*` is txd's ONLY public read surface — side-effect-free by
  construction. "entities" is dead as public API vocabulary, and the old
  per-entity event-history endpoint is REMOVED: agent-biography serving is not
  txd's job. The internal event stream stays the private replay/reconcile truth.

## Contracts

The lifecycle vocabulary (`schema_version`, the seed event types, axes,
send/stop/close/subscribe shapes) lives in `@terminus-os/contracts` (`./txd`
module) — the daemon pins `SCHEMA_VERSION` exactly. No `file:` links, no
token-api dependency, no compat layer.

## Config

Env/config-driven — no hardcoded machine values. A JSON file pointed at by
`TXD_CONFIG` wins; otherwise env vars; otherwise localhost-safe defaults. Keys
(see `txd.config.example.json`):

| Key          | Env                                     | Default                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `bind`       | `TXD_BIND`                              | `127.0.0.1`                                |
| `port`       | `TXD_PORT`                              | `7781`                                     |
| `machine`    | `IMPERIUM_MACHINE`                      | **none — fail loud** (never guess the box) |
| `db`         | `TXD_DB_SOCKET_DIR` / `TXD_DB_DATABASE` | socket `/var/run/postgresql`, db `terminus`|
| `tmuxSocket` | `TXD_TMUX_SOCKET`                       | `k12`                                      |

`machine` has **no default**: a daemon that guesses its own box identity is a
bug, so config load fails loud when it is unset.

`db` is a `@terminus-os/db` endpoint object (strict-validated — unknown fields
refuse loud). On fleet boxes it is the sanctioned shape: the native PostgreSQL
18 cluster's peer-auth unix socket — no password field exists.

## Persistence — PostgreSQL 18

The event stream lives in the `terminus` database, schema `txd`, table
`txd.events` — the 8 ruled columns, nothing derived:

| Column        | Type     | Notes                                             |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `seq`         | `bigint` | identity, monotonic — assigned by the store       |
| `entity_type` | `text`   | `seat` \| `instance` \| `send`                    |
| `entity_id`   | `text`   | canonical id (never a raw tmux `%id`)             |
| `event_type`  | `text`   | pinned vocabulary (`@terminus-os/contracts`)      |
| `payload`     | `jsonb`  | dumb facts only, never derived state              |
| `provenance`  | `jsonb`  | source + transport receipt + emitter version      |
| `occurred_at` | `text`   | attested ISO-8601, stored verbatim                |
| `recorded_at` | `text`   | daemon clock; skew vs `occurred_at` is visible    |

Append-only is STRUCTURAL: triggers raise on `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and
`TRUNCATE`. The schema ships as `packages/db/migrations/0002_txd_events.sql`
(the shared forward-only migrations home) and the daemon applies pending
migrations at boot — a pristine database and a current one converge on the
same shape.

### Config bootstrap — seeding `~/secrets/txd/txd.json`

The unit sets `TXD_CONFIG=%h/secrets/txd/txd.json` and guards it with
`ConditionPathExists` on the same path: while the file is absent the unit is
**skipped cleanly** (visible condition-failed status in
`systemctl --user status txd`), never a crashloop. The Token-Fleet apply leg
ensures only the `~/secrets/txd` dir (mode 700) — the file itself is a
one-time per-box seed.

No key is a secret: every field is an operational value (peer auth means no
credential exists). On a k12 box the seed is the example config verbatim
(adjust `machine` per box):

```bash
install -m 600 /dev/null ~/secrets/txd/txd.json
cat > ~/secrets/txd/txd.json <<'EOF'
{
  "bind": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 7781,
  "machine": "k12-personal",
  "db": {
    "kind": "socket",
    "socket_dir": "/var/run/postgresql",
    "database": "terminus",
    "application_name": "txd"
  },
  "tmuxSocket": "k12"
}
EOF
systemctl --user restart txd
```

### tmux server privilege boundary

`txd.service` runs with `NoNewPrivileges=true`, but the persistent tmux server
must not be its child. Linux carries `NoNewPrivileges` across fork and exec; a
server started by txd therefore passes `NoNewPrivs=1` to every pane, making
setuid/capability-dependent tools such as `sudo`, `snap-confine`, and `lxc`
unusable estate-wide. `txd-tmux.service` is the dedicated unsandboxed server
owner. txd only connects to its socket and refuses loudly if that external
server is absent; it never falls back to starting the server itself.

For a one-off command that needs an unsandboxed scope before the durable unit
is deployed, use `systemd-run --user --pipe --wait <cmd>`.

The units' boundary and directive lines (WorkingDirectory under the box's
`live/` checkout, ordering, condition guard, NoNewPrivileges split, KillMode,
ExecStart, and PrivateTmp absence) are pinned in `test/systemd-unit.test.ts`.

## Develop

Bun-native — TypeScript source runs directly, no build step. From the repo root:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck
bun test packages/txd
bun packages/txd/src/daemon.ts   # run (needs IMPERIUM_MACHINE or TXD_CONFIG)
```

## Deploy — systemd `--user` via the Token-Fleet apply leg

`systemd/txd-tmux.service` owns the unsandboxed persistent tmux server;
`systemd/txd.service` requires it and owns only the sandboxed daemon. Both are
user-scoped. Delivery/installation is a Token-Fleet apply leg scoped to k12-personal —
apply legs install units to `~/.config/systemd/user/` and reload, root-free —
including the runtime write-lock cycle (unlock via scoped CI sudo → propagate →
re-lock). Config is provisioned at `~/secrets/txd/txd.json` — the `~/secrets/txd`
subdir (mode 700) is what the Token-Fleet apply leg (`shared/bin/apply-txd`)
ensures on the box, resolving the extraction spec's sole open minor (§3.5/§7)
in favor of the fleet leg that actually provisions it.

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now txd-tmux.service txd.service
tx probes it by name: systemctl --user start txd; GET /ctl/health; POST /ctl/reconcile
```
